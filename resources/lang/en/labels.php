This would consequently shift the focus of “studying English” in a conventional classroom setting, to “enjoying English” in a more relaxing and comfortable environment.',
    'Eatt_why_english_detail_2'=>'This approach has been proven successful in my own experience, studying Japanese, when I cook from recipe books written in Japanese, watch the multitude of cooking programs on Japanese television and visit the myriad of restaurants that Tokyo has to offer to then find myself in conversation with the Japanese waiter about the dish of the day or a wine he or she has to recommend.',

    'Eatt_ryan_ahamer_detail_3'=>'Back in the 80s, it was an adult’s only affair, and kids were…well, kids. However I would always be waiting in anticipation of the extravagant dinner about to be prepared; hanging around the busy kitchen, not really helping, just hoping to taste whatever was making the mouth watering aroma.',

    'Eatt_ryan_ahamer_detail_7'=>'In my food and beverage career, I started working in cafes when I was 15. When I graduated from high school I entered Chef College where I finished top of the class. I then worked at “The Lenzerheide” a Swiss restaurant.',
    'Eatt_ryan_ahamer_detail_8'=>'My eagerness to not only to cook but learn every aspect of restaurant operations lead me to become, a barman, floor-staff, supervisor and manager at various kinds of establishments from fancy cafes to fine dining restaurants. I also studied business management at both Adelaide and Brisbane universities to completely equip myself with 20 years of practical and business management skills for food and beverage operations. At present, I own and operate a language school, Accent Language. My ambitions are to create businesses which harmoniously combine food and beverage, language education, and tech.',

Not only language but the ability to use the English language to express, debate, and promote ideas across a vast range of situations. Words are but words until they are put to good use.A small task like an email, or a critical presentation, using the correct words is key to moving forward in business. As a teacher, it is not his job to teach how to speak, but to teach how to better express oneself with one’s own words through the use of a foreign language. This method to my knowledge is the best approach to a concrete language learning experience.',
